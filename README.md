How It Works

- News is scraped from Hindustan Times based on the selected category using requests and BeautifulSoup.
- The backend exposes a /api/news endpoint that returns news data in JSON format.
- Bookmarked headlines are stored in the Flask session and can be retrieved via /api/bookmarks.
- The frontend dynamically displays headlines and bookmarks using vanilla JavaScript.

Planned Enhancements

- AI-generated summaries for each headline
- Export option to save headlines as PDF
- User authentication and login system
- Daily email alerts with top headlines
- Support for scraping custom URLs with CSS selectors
- Persistent bookmark storage in a database (e.g., SQLite or MongoDB)
